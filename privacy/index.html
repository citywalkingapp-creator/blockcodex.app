      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective: February 7, 2026</p>

      <h2>Location Data</h2>
      <p>Block Codex collects your location only while you are actively
  recording a walk. Location data is stored entirely on your device. The app
  does not collect location data in the background.</p>

      <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
      <p>If you enable iCloud sync, your walk progress (walked segments and
  statistics) is synced via your personal iCloud account. This data is governed
  by Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy. No walk data is sent to any other
  server.</p>

      <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
      <p>Block Codex does not include any analytics frameworks, advertising
  SDKs, or third-party tracking. No data is shared with third parties.</p>

      <h2>No Account Required</h2>
      <p>The app does not require you to create an account. There is no sign-up,
   no login, and no personal information collected beyond your GPS coordinates
  during active walks.</p>

      <h2>Street Map Data</h2>
      <p>Street geometry data is derived from OpenStreetMap and is bundled
  directly within the app. No network requests are made to load street data.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a
  new effective date.</p>
